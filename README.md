# Alfred Workflow: Transmit

This workflow shows you a list of your connections that are stored inside Transmit. Type `ftp` into Alfred (with or without arguments), and it will show you a list of connections in full, or filtered by your entered argument.

Then it allows you to:

- Press `Enter` to open the connection in the existing window/tab of Transmit
- Press `CMD+Enter` to open the connection in a new tab of Transmit
